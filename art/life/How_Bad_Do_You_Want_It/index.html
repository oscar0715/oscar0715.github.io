<p>There was a young man, you know,<br>who wanted to make a lot of money<br>and so he went to this guru, right.<br>And he told the guru you know<br>I wanna be on the same level<br>you are and the guru said<br>if you wanna be on the same level I’m on,<br>I’ll met you tomorrow at the beach. </p>
<p>So the young man got there 4 A.M. he already to rock n’ roll.<br>Got on a suit should of wore shorts.<br>The old man grabs his hand and said:<br>How bad do you wanna be successful?<br>He said: “Real bad”.<br>He said: Walk on out in the water.<br>So he walks out into the water. Watch this.<br>When he walks out to the water<br>he goes waist deep and goes like this guy crazy. </p>
<p>Hey I wanna make money and he got me out here swimming.<br>I didn’t ask to be a lifeguard.<br>I wanna make money he got me in<br>so he said come on a little further<br>walked out a little further<br>then he had it right around this area<br>the shoulder area<br>so this old man crazy<br>he making money but he crazy.<br>So he said come on out a little further<br>came out a little further, it was right at his mouth<br>my man, I’m not about to go back in this guy is out of his mind. And the old man said:<br>“I thought you said you wanted to be successful?”<br>He said: “I do.”<br>He said: “Then walk a little further.”<br>He came, dropped his head in, held him down,<br>hold him down, my man (kept scratching) hold him down,<br>he had him held down,<br>just before my man was about to pass out,<br>he raised him up.<br>He said: “I got a question for you.”<br>He told the guy, he said:<br>“When you want to succeed as bad as<br>you wanna breathe than you will be successful.” </p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you all got asthma here today?<br>If you ever had a asthma attack before your short of breath S.O.B shortness of breath,<br>you wheezing (breath sound) the only thing<br>you trying to do is get some air.<br>You don’t care about no basketball game,<br>you don’t care about what’s on T.V.,<br>you don’t care about nobody calling you,<br>you don’t care about a party.<br>The only thing you care about<br>when you trying to breathe is to get some fresh air.<br>That’s it!<br>And when you get to the point<br>where all you wanna do is<br>be is successful as bad as<br>you wanna breathe then you will be successful.<br>And I’m here to tell you that number one,<br>most of you say you wanna be successful<br>but you don’t want it bad, you just kind of want it.<br>You don’t want it bad than you wanna party.<br>You don’t want it as much as you want to be cool.<br>Most of you don’t want success as much as you want sleep.<br>Some of you lost sleep more than you lost success.<br>And I’m here to tell you today,<br>if your going to be successful<br>you gotta be willing to give up sleep.<br>You gotta be willing to work with 3 hours of sleep<br>2 hours of sleep, if you really wanna be successful.<br>Some day your gonna have to stay up 3 days in a row.<br>Because if you go to sleep you might miss<br>the opportunity to be successful.<br>That’s how bad you gotta (inaudible). </p>
<p>You gotta go days without<br>LISTEN TO ME!<br>You gotta want to be successful so bad that you forget to eat.<br>My ( ) said say,<br>once she was on the set doing her thang,<br>three days had gone by and she forgot that she didn’t eat. Cause she was engaged.<br>I never forget,<br>I went, 50 Cent was doing his movie,<br>I did a little research on 50<br>and 50 said: that when he wasn’t do the movie he was doing the soundtrack.<br>And they said: “When do you sleep?” 50,<br>and 50 said: “Sleep, sleep is for those people who are broke.<br>I don’t sleep.” See I got an opportunity to make my dream become a reality.<br>Don’t cry to quits.<br>You already in pain, you already hurt.<br>Get a reward from it. Don’t go to sleep until you succeed.<br>Listen to me,<br>I’m here to tell you today you can come here and<br>and you can jump up – you can do flips and you can be excited when we give away money but listen to me,<br>you will never be successful,<br>I don’t have to give you a dime if you …<br>You won’t be successful until you say I don’t need that money cause I got it in here. </p>

<p>So you thought it was the end of the story. (laughs)<br>So you thought just because the student was willing to be obedient to the guru and not only wake up but meet him at the beach early in the morning.<br>You thought that was enough. [knocking]<br>Ah I got it. So you thought he was willing to walk out to the deep of the ocean that that was enough you because the guru placed his head under the water, pulled it out and taught him that the secret to success is wanting it as bad as you wanna breathe.<br>So you thought that was the end of the story. You thought that one single event that one single moment was enough for him to stand amongst the greats to make his dream become reality.<br>Well you thought wrong. In fact, it’s far from over. That was the easy part. </p>
<p>Now…Now it’s time to redefine the grind. You thought it was over?<br>Well it’s just getting started.<br>See, this is the part. This is the part where life demands you make a life long commitment, this is the part where life demands that you make a vow come hail or high water, that you’re willing to pay the price the full fare where you earn your spot with effort, with sweat, with blood, with tears. And so you say, you want it as bad as you wanna breathe.<br>Then it’s show time! It’s examination time. It’s time to get tested, to test your will, your endurance, it’s time to test your art, to test your limits. This is the art where you re-invent yourself. </p>
<p>Sleep. I don’t sleep.<br>You thought that was it.<br>It goes deeper than going without sleep because you might miss the opportunity to succeed.<br>No, no, no it’s about no days off – no weekends, no holidays, no birthdays. Listen to me! No days off! No half days! No holidays! No snow day! It’s about gaining the competitive edge. It’s about separation.<br>It’s about separating yourself from the pack, the competition.<br>It’s about being a little faster, a little stronger. </p>
<p>Listen to me.<br>A little faster than you were last year, last month, last week.<br>In fact, you gotta be a little faster today than you were yesterday.<br>And you can’t afford on the road to success, you can’t afford to make excuses.<br>No excuses when you feel pain. And trust me, you will feel it.<br>You gotta go deep deep down, beyond, beyond exhaustion, beyond (a workout) and when it’s harder than you imagined it would be, when it takes longer than you thought it would take and when the load is heavy than you thought you could bare and all you wanna do is give up and all you wanna do is give in, when you feel like you’ve given all you got, you gotta take one more step, you gotta run one more lap. </p>
<p>You gotta throw one more punch and disregard how much more does it take.<br>You gotta fight back. You gotta fight a little harder.<br>You gotta defeat disappointment, annihilate weakness and punish the competition.<br>It’s about pushing yourself beyond the limits.<br>It’s about perfecting the you, not just doing more, not just being better but finding your best.<br>Listen to me…<br>It’s more than you want it so bad than you wanna breathe that’s not enough, you gotta be willing to face every fear, climb every mountain, defy every odd, on-slot every obstacle, one step at a time, one day at a time, until you – only you are left standing – there’s no one else and there’s nothing in your way. </p>
<p>Until you reach the top.</p>
<h1 id="Kobe"><a href="#Kobe" class="headerlink" title="Kobe"></a>Kobe</h1><p>The most beautiful part about any craft is starting at the beginning. That is just the most purest form of artistry. Because you have to learn the buidling blocks, every little step, all the fundamentals. I mean, That’s the most beautiful part to me.</p>
<p>You start with where you want your game to be… What would make your game the most unstoppable, or hard to deal with… And now you work backward from there. You start building it one piece at a time, one move at a time, one counter at a time.</p>
<p>At the age of 18, this was my life, right? so you can’t possibly become better than me because you’re not spending the time on it that I do..</p>
<p>That’s the only way you get better is by pushing yourself pass exhausted.</p>
<p>Now image you wake up at 3, you train at 4, from 4 to 6, come home, breakfast, relax, ……<br>now you back at the game, now it’s 11, relax, be back at it again, 2 to 4, you back at it again 7 to 9, Look, how much more training I have done by simplely starting at 4. Right, So now you do that as the years go on, the separation that you have with your competitors and peers just grows larger and larger and larger and larger and larger. By year five or six, it doesn’t no matter what kind of work they do in the summer, you’re never going to catch up.</p>
<p>There’s a choice that we have to make as people, as individuals, If you wanna be great at something. There’s a choice that you have to make. We all can be masters at our craft. But you have to make a choice.</p>
